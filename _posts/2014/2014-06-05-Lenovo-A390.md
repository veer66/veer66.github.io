Date: 2014/06/05


My Lenovo A390 is still usable after I bought it 9-10 months ago. I don't like its touchscreen, its battery life, its GPS and its camera; I like its cute home screen, its body and its price.

Nowadays on a bus or a van, I try to practice meditation instead of listening to music, reading feeds, etc.; thus I can extend its battery life. Even I don't like the camera and the touchscreen, they are usable. About the GPS, I have no solution.
