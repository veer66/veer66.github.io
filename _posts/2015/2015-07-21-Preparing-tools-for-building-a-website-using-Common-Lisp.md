# Preparing tools for building a website using Common Lisp
Date: 2015/07/21


I did search for tools/libraries for building a website using Common Lisp.
So I just want to take note here and maybe it is useful for others too.
BTW please note that I have never used them yet.

* [Ningle](https://github.com/fukamachi/ningle) - a Sinatra-like web framework
* [Arrows](https://github.com/KeenS/arrows) - a Jinja2-like template engine 
* [cl-rabbit](https://github.com/lokedhs/cl-rabbit/) - a RabbitMQ interface 
* [ironclad](http://method-combination.net/lisp/ironclad/) - Password encryption
* [mongo-cl-driver](https://github.com/archimag/mongo-cl-driver) - A MongoDB driver

These should be enough for building the server side of a small website, shouldn't them?
