# (move 'picocms 'jekyll)

I happened to think what if I die, who will pay for my hosting. So today I migrate my main website and blog posts from PicoCMS hosted at Scaleway to Jekyll hosted at Github.

PicoCMS and Jekyll are based on Markdown so I just wrote a script for renaming my blog post file name and modifing some metadata by the shell script below: 

````Sh
for x in *.md
do 
   T=`head -n4 $x | grep '^Title:' | sed 's/Title: //' | sed 's/[ "\|?\/\(\)]/-/g'` 
   D=`head -n4 $x | grep '^Date' | sed 's/Date: //' | sed 's/\//-/g'`
   mv $x $D-$T.md
done
for x in *.md
do 
   cat $x | sed 's/\/\*//' | sed 's/\*\///' | sed 's/Title: /# /' > t && mv t $x 
done
````

If I outlive Github, I can just generate this site and host it somewhere else.
